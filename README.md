### Shameless 2D Mario-esque platformer made with Python / Pygame

### TODO:
- [ ] Player profiles
- [ ] Working speedrun timer
- [ ] SQL-backend
- [ ] Main menu using HTML, CSS & Javascript
- [ ] Add 5 terrain types
- [ ] Visual enchantments
- [ ] Sound Optimization


### How is the game on the web despite using Python?
All python code is converted to WebAssembly using pygbag and put into an .apk
front-end is coded with html, css & javascript.



### Things I won't do or fix:
* Easily scalable Terrain tiles
* Collision, it's already best it can be
* Increase performance further, I will not change each image to a webp




Too lazy to use Git the correct way, will just dump everything here



## Credits
* Coding side done by Aapo & Niila
* Sprite creation and re-design by daemon_404
